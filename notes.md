It's looking good so far, I just have a couple of notes about the design:
- Font in the search results should be adjusted so it's vertically centered
- Search bar should be scaled at the same rate as search button (should be the same height)
- Drop shadows should be smaller (see mockup)
- Font should be updated to reflect pill-bottle look (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anaheim?query=Anaheim)
- Need to update the help page
- I think we might want to set a max width for the white parts of the page to be 1.5 times that of a phone. It looks a little bit too big right now
- When displaying distance in miles, the text clips over the link icon

Other than that it's looking great!
