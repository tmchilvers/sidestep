            </p>
            <p class="about">

            <h3>Safety Level</h3>
            <p class="about">
                &emsp;This dropdown allows you to choose how safe you want to be when venturing out. <b>Safe</b> will have a lower danger cutoff than <b>Risky</b>, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="about">
                &emsp;Every time you choose a new value from this dropdown, it will clear your search results, as updating this requires an entirely new search.
            </p>


            <h3>Category</h3>

            <p class="about">
                &emsp;This dropdown allows you to choose what sort of business/location you're searching for.
            </p>
            <p class="about">
                &emsp;This dropdown will also clear the search results, as it requires a new search to update the search results.
            </p>


            <h3>Units</h3>

            <p class="about">
                &emsp;This dropdown allows you to choose metric or imperial as your display units.
            </p>
            <p class="about">
                &emsp;This can be updated without searching again, as all distances remain the same and are simply displayed differently.
            </p>


            <h3>Sorting</h3>

            <p class="about">
                &emsp;This dropdown allows you to choose how you want to sort the search results. This doesn't require a reload as it simply changes the order of the results.
            </p>


            <h3>Search Radius</h3>

            <p class="about">
                &emsp;This allows you to choose the radius that you want to search in.
            </p>


            <h3>Search Results</h3>

            <p class="about">
                &emsp;Search results are displayed as small cards that can be opened or closed by tapping on the dark-grey header. Each result displays the location name, as well as your distance from it.
            </p>

            <p class="about">
                &emsp;Once opened, each will display a short bit of information about the location, as well as provide a link to the location in Google Mapsâ„¢.
            </p>

            <h3>Danger Metric</h3>

            <p class="about">
                &emsp;The danger metric is simply a numeric representation of how dangerous we believe the current location to be.
            </p>
            <p class="about">
                &emsp;Currently, each danger metric is the number of infected people at an epicenter divided by the distance between that epicenter and the location in question. The displayed danger metric is the largest value given for that location in relation to any epicenter.
